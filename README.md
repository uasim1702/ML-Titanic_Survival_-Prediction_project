# Titanic Survival Prediction  

A machine learning project using the Titanic dataset to predict survival outcomes.  
Tested six different models to compare performance and results.  

---

## Models  

- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine(SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN)  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- Gradient Boosting  

---

## Results

Random Forest and Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy.---

## How to Run  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uasim1702/ML-Titanic_Survival_-Prediction_project
cd ML-Titanic_Survival_-Prediction_project
pip install -r requirements.txt
